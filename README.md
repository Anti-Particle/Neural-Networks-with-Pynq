Our newest product here at FPGA corp. Will revolutionize the field of AI, and more specifically the neural networks used in it. By emulating the structure of neural networks in FPGAs, we estimate a 20% decrease in power consumption, 40% decrease in processing time, and a 100% decrease in memory usage in implemented neural networks.

Advanced neural networks, due to the amount of simulated neurons, consume high amounts of processing power, memory, and time to run and train. While the training of neural networks needs to be done by a processor, since the overall structure is constantly changing, running an implemented neural network does not. Because already trained neural networks are not dynamic structures, they can be implemented as physical hardware which will be much faster and resource efficient than a processor.

The neural network deployer works by automating the creation of a Vivado block design using custom made neuron IP blocks (developed in a hardware development language) arranged in such a manner that they recreate the structure of an existing neural network. The trained structure of the neural network comes from a .pt file which contains a pretrained pytorch neural network. The block design is then converted to a bitstream file which is then deployable to a suitable FPGA. The inputs to said neural network are then set up on the programming software of the FPGA board.

*“Due to the recent ‘AI boom’ the use of neural networks across all industries has been growing at a rapid pace. One of the largest bottlenecks for this technology is the high resource usage. We saw that this bottleneck could be easily solved by using an already existing technology in novel ways.” \-Company Leader*

Clients can provide a .pt file to the system which will then generate a bitstream file which can be deployed to a Zynq FPGA. A wrapper jupyter notebook file will be provided so that the client can set up the inputs of the neural networks and forward out the neural networks outputs. Alternatively, the inputs and outputs can be set up through a usb connection.

*“The offloading of neural networks to FPGAs has significantly reduced power costs and reduced overall processing time for requests. This has reduced costs and lead to a faster user experience” \- CEO of AI Based Client Company*

### **FAQ**

**Q:** What are the advantages of using an FPGA for neural networks over more traditional devices like GPUs and TPUs?

**A:** GPUs and TPUs use many simple processors to simulate the neurons and synapsis of a neural network, which can take a long time since each processor can only perform simple instructions, requiring multiple instructions to perform a simple task, like simulating a single neuron. FPGAs can be “programmed” in a way that the hardware inside physically recreates the connection of the neural network and calculates the result of the neural network almost instantly.

**Q:** Why are FPGAs not already used for the implementation of neural networks?

**A:** FPGAs are limited by their size (Logic Cell count) so large enough neural networks can be outside of their scope. Processors perform instructions one at a time and are consequently only limited by the amount of memory available. Modern processors, which operate sequentially, are approaching a clock speed bottleneck while FPGAs, which can operate combinationally, can be continually expanded.
